Jag saknar dig ibland
Jag ser dig
Jag skiter
Jag skulle vilja tänka en underbar tanke
Jag tror på oss
Jag tror på sommaren
Jag vill ha en egen måne
Jag vill leva i Europa
Jag vill om du vågar
Jag vill vara din, Margareta
Jag är ett bedårande barn av min tid
Jag är fri
Jag ångrar ingenting
Jag önskar er alla en riktigt god jul
